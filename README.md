# The Impact of Transitioning to ZEV's on California's Natural Gas Emmissions
Final Project - Exploring the emission impacts 

## Week 1

- *Selected Topic*: Our topic is a data analysis of the impact of natural gas use if California meets its goal of 5 million electric vehicles (EVs) on the road by 2030.

- *Reason Why Topic Was Selected:*
We chose this subject for several reasons. First on a macro level the topic has direct pertinence to the effects on our living environment, pollutant levels and greenhouse effects . More importantly the topic is significant to a particular program goals that is trying to be implemented in California and this predictive model should produce analysis that would effect policy change and implementation.  

- *Description of Source of Data:*

California has been at the forefront of renewable energy in the United States and has made significant progress. Most of the energy-related data is collected by California Energy Commission (CEC) in the form of raw data and reports. Most of the data we are looking for is located here and related energy agencies. 

Some examples of our data are:

- *Questions We Hope to Answer:*
How does increased use of electric vehicle impact natural gas consumption in California?
How does time of day impact the carbon intensity of EV charging?
