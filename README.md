# The Impact of Transitioning to ZEV's on California's Natural Gas Emmissions
Final Project - Exploring the emission impacts 

## Introduction

### *Selected Topic*: 
For our project we will preform a data analysis on the impact of increased electric vehicle charging on California's natural gas usage.

### *Reason Why Topic Was Selected:*
California has set a goal of getting 5 million electric vehicles (EVs) on the road by 2030. While this electrficiation will move the state towards it's climate change goals, if residents charge electric vehicles at night when the grid is more natural gas intensive, this EV charging can impact California's natural gas emissions. We chose this subject for several reasons. First on a macro level the topic has direct pertinence to the effects on our living environment, pollutant levels and greenhouse effects . More importantly the topic is significant to a particular program goals that is trying to be implemented in California and this predictive model should produce analysis that would effect policy change and implementation.  

### *Description of Source of Data:*
California has been at the forefront of renewable energy in the United States and has made significant progress. There has been a significant amount of data relevant to ZEVs collected by [California Energy Commission (CEC)](https://www.energy.ca.gov/) in the form of raw data and reports. We also wanted to look at other sources and goverment sites that could allow us to measure the natural gas intakes in the state over the last several years. At first, we found a great amount of data regarding demand values through the CAISO API, (https://developer.caiso.com/) but opted for a different table and set of data collected by the site. We also used a great deal of information for calculating our demand values from the National Bureau of Economic Research working papers regarding EVs (pls see reference folder). We also used several other sites and resources that we added to our folder. 

### *Questions We Hope to Answer:*
- How does increased use of electric vehicle impact natural gas consumption in California?

## Our Process


### *Description of Data Exploration:*
Our search process for the data was difficult at first due to data requiring payment to access. So, we did a lot of research on our topic to gain a better understanding and find reliable sources that can offer the data that we need. After our research, we found a great deal of data in the supply and demand section of [California ISO]( https://www.caiso.com/todaysoutlook/Pages/index.html) which we collected and have included our scape code along side. We had looked for the EV demand in MW over the last several years, but to this day no organization has actually sucessfully been able to collect such data or created a structure to do so. We agreed to make the best attempt constructing a demand value by applying the findings of the NBER's recent study to the number of EVs registered in California derived from a report published by the California Eneregy Commission. Our demand only concentrated on Electric Vehicle and Level 2 battery charging at homes. Next, we gathered data from [Sun Country Highway]( https://suncountryhighway.ca/ev-charge-times/) charge times using web scraping as well as data and tables from https://insideevs.com/reviews/344001/compare-evs/ for ranges in milage.
