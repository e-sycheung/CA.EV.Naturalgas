# The Impact of Transitioning to ZEV's on California's Natural Gas Emmissions
Final Project - Exploring the emission impacts 

## Introduction

### *Selected Topic*: 
For our project we will preform a data analysis on the impact of increased electric vehicle charging on California's natural gas usage.

### *Reason Why Topic Was Selected:*
California has set a goal of getting 5 million electric vehicles (EVs) on the road by 2030. While this electrficiation will move the state towards it's climate change goals, if residents charge electric vehicles at night when the grid is more natural gas intensive, this EV charging can impact California's natural gas emissions. We chose this subject for several reasons. First on a macro level the topic has direct pertinence to the effects on our living environment, pollutant levels and greenhouse effects . More importantly the topic is significant to a particular program goals that is trying to be implemented in California and this predictive model should produce analysis that would effect policy change and implementation.  

### *Description of Source of Data:*
California has been at the forefront of renewable energy in the United States and has made significant progress. Most of the energy-related data is collected by [California Energy Commission (CEC)](https://www.energy.ca.gov/) in the form of raw data and reports. Most of the data we are looking for is located here and related energy agencies. 

### *Questions We Hope to Answer:*
- How does increased use of electric vehicle impact natural gas consumption in California?
- How does time of day impact the carbon intensity of EV charging?

## Our Process


### *Description of Data Exploration:*
Our search process for the data was difficult at first due to data requiring payment to access. So, we did a lot of research on our topic to gain a better understanding and find reliable sources that can offer the data that we need. After our research, we found a great deal of data in the supply and demand section of [California ISO]( https://www.caiso.com/todaysoutlook/Pages/index.html). Next, we gathered data from [Sun Country Highway]( https://suncountryhighway.ca/ev-charge-times/) charge times using web scraping.

### *Description of Analysis Phase:*

### *Description of the Communication Protocols:*
Communication and open dialogue have been a key component in this group project. There are several prongs of communication that we have implemented. 
1. Day to day: Slack or gmail for communications, quick questions, ideas, and suggestions.
2. Meets outside of Class: Google Calendar/Hangouts and Zoom. 
3. Resources and Code Collaboration: GitHub and GoogleDrive.

### *Project Outline:*

The Presention will be done through [Google Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zOBPyaSprh2AsAN8pwAGuNuXHJgk6bz7/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=109076473530108295539&rtpof=true&sd=true)
